# Make-Pizza-Project
The Make Pizza Project is a fun and interactive Windows Forms application that simulates the process of making a pizza. Users can customize their pizza by selecting various toppings, choosing the size, and specifying the quantity. The application calculates the total cost of the pizza based on the user's selections and provides a summary of the order.

This project is designed to demonstrate the use of C# and Windows Forms for building a user-friendly desktop application with real-world functionality.
